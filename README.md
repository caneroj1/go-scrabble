<h1>Go Scrabble</h1>

A simple command-line interface written in Go for keeping score in scrabble.

My first foray into the Go language, this is a port of
a ruby program I made to simply automate the keeping
of score when playing scrabble.

<h2>Using</h2>
* In your github.com directory of your Go workspace, make a caneroj1 directory.
* In that directory, run `git clone https://github.com/caneroj1/scrabble.git`
* From inside the scrabble directory, run: `go build`
OR
* From anywhere, run: `go build github.com/caneroj1/scrabble`
* Next, from inside the scrabble directory, run: `go install`
OR
* From anywhere, run: `go install github.com/caneroj1/scrabble`
* Finally, you can now run `scrabble`
